- 👋 Hi, I’m @pyroargie. This is an entirely new world for me, I'm just trying to do my best to learn about programming and everything that's related to the IT world
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at the Oracle Next Education platform. I'm also watching (when I can) videos, about different topics around programing languages 
- 🙏 English isn't my native languague, so if I'm commiting some mistakes here, I beg your pardon. Bye!
